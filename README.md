# Mock Data Set for SNP 4934 and CBGA Concentration

## Overview
This repository contains a **mock dataset** for **SNP 4934** and its associated **CBGA concentration** (% w/w). The data was generated using simulated methods and serves to demonstrate a framework for **SNP validation studies** in **cannabis genetics**. The mock data is used to illustrate how to integrate SNP validation protocols into breeding programs.

## Purpose
- To test the effectiveness of **SNP 4934** in predicting **CBGA levels**.
- To serve as a framework for future SNP validation studies in **cannabis genetics**.
- The dataset and analysis demonstrate how to standardize protocols and ensure transparency in SNP validation before integrating SNPs into breeding programs.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Plant ID**: Unique identifier for each plant.
- **Genotype**: Genotypic classification for each plant (AA, AG, GG).
- **CBGA Concentration (% w/w)**: The measured **CBGA concentration** for each plant, determined by **HPLC**.

## Methodology
- **Genotype Verification**: The **genotypes** were verified using **KASP PCR assays**.
- **CBGA Measurement**: **CBGA concentrations** were measured using **HPLC**.
